# stringcoin-game
C++ program to implement a game called Strings and Coins.

At the beginning of the game, there is a network
of coins, each connected by four strings. Two players take turns cutting a string in the network.
When a cut leaves a coin with no strings connected, the player scores one point and takes an extra
turn. Note that the player can get more than two successive turns as long as s/he keeps scoring in
every turn. The game ends when all strings are cut, and the player with more points wins. It is a draw
if two players get the same points.
